# Geo test data

This directory previously contained small geographic datasets that powered the Deck.gl based map analysis features. Those features
have been removed from the application, but the sample files are retained here for historical reference or manual experiments.

- `tokyo_points.csv` – point-based metrics with latitude/longitude columns, WKT geometries, and categorical groupings.
- `tokyo_routes.geojson` – a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` with representative paths and polygons around Tokyo landmarks.

All coordinates use the WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326).
